## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development version:

   ```bash
   yarn tauri dev
   ```

The application will automatically load all modules defined in the modules library.

## Development

This application uses:

- **Tauri**: Core framework connecting Rust backend with React frontend
- **React**: Frontend UI library for the user interface
- **Rust**: Backend modules and core functionality

## Building

### Build the complete application

```bash
yarn tauri build
```

This will generate executables for your platform in the `src-tauri/target/release` folder.

### Build only the modules library

```bash
cargo build -p modules --release --config modules/.cargo/config.toml
```

### Optimize binary size

Compress the binary files for smaller distribution:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
upx --best modules

# Windows (better compression)
upx --best --lzma modules
```

## Features Guide

### Download Manager

Download manga using the intuitive interface:

- Select from supported websites
- Search for titles
- Set download request frequency
- Monitor download progress in real-time

### Library Management

Keep track of your manga collection:

- View all downloaded series
- Auto-download new chapters for tracked series

### Image Processing

Process downloaded content:

- Merge vertical panels into single images
- Resize and fit images to eliminate white space
- Automatically merge each webtoon after downloading it

### PDF Conversion

Convert chapters or series to PDF:

- Create chapter-by-chapter PDFs
- Automatically convert each webtoon after downloading it

### Search Engine

Find new content easily:

- Search across multiple websites simultaneously
- Filter results by genre, status, and more
- Preview content before downloading
- Sort results by popularity or relevance

### Sauce Finder

Identify the source of manga images:

- Upload local images
- Provide URLs to images
- Get detailed source information
- Direct links to read or download

## Modules

The application uses a modular architecture with Rust-based modules for different websites. Each module implements a common interface to handle:

- Website navigation
- Content detection
- Download management
- Error handling

Modules are loaded dynamically at runtime and can be updated independently of the main application.

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a hybrid architecture:

- **Frontend (React)**: User interface, state management, and interaction
- **Backend (Rust)**: Core functionality, web scraping, file system operations
- **Communication**: Tauri IPC for frontend-backend communication
- **Modules**: Specialized Rust libraries for website-specific functionality
